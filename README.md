# Express Server for Kubernetes Operations

This is a Node.js Express server that allows you to perform various Kubernetes operations through REST API endpoints. It provides functionality for deploying and deleting lab objects in a Kubernetes cluster, as well as retrieving information about namespaces.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-kubernetes-server.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd express-kubernetes-server
   npm install
   ```

3. Modify the `Labs/Test/ObjectStorageLab.yaml` file to suit your needs. This file contains the template for the lab object to be deployed in Kubernetes.

4. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start listening on port 2090 by default. You can modify the port by changing the `PORT` constant in the `index.ts` file.

## API Endpoints

### Deploy Lab Object

- Endpoint: POST `/api/labs/objectstorage`
- Request Body:

  ```json
  {
    "namespaceName": "my-namespace",
    "labId": 123,
    "app": "my-app",
    "accessKey": "my-access-key",
    "secretKey": "my-secret-key"
  }
  ```

- Response: HTTP 200 OK
  - Body: "Deployed Lab"

### Delete Lab Object

- Endpoint: DELETE `/api/labs/objectstorage`
- Request Body: Same as the deploy endpoint
- Response: HTTP 200 OK
  - Body: "Lab deleted"

### Get Namespace Info

- Endpoint: GET `/api/info/:namespace`
- URL Parameter: `namespace` - The name of the namespace to retrieve information about
- Response: HTTP 200 OK
  - Body: JSON object containing namespace information

## Error Handling

- If a request fails validation against the specified schema, a 400 Bad Request response will be returned with a JSON object containing the validation errors.
